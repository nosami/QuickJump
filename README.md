# QuickJump
EasyMotion clone for MonoDevelop and Xamarin Studio 6.0 and higher

Press `cmd+j` to trigger, then the first character of the word that you want to jump to and then the hint character that is displayed on screen.

![QuickJump demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nosami/nosami.github.io/master/quickjump.gif)

Only word jumps are currently supported. PRs accepted! You will need the MonoDevelop/XS Addin Maker addin installed if you want to work on the code.
